# üöÄ User Acquisition Strategy - Weather Intelligence API

## üéØ High-Impact Features for Maximum User Growth

Based on market research and developer needs, here are the best investments of your time:

## PHASE 1: Quick Wins (Week 1-2) üèÜ

### 1. **Free Tier with Generous Limits**
```
Current: Demo key only
Better: Public free tier with 1,000 requests/month
Impact: 10x more sign-ups, lower barrier to entry
```

### 2. **SDK/Code Examples in Popular Languages**
```python
# Python SDK Example
import weather_intelligence

client = weather_intelligence.Client("your_api_key")
weather = client.current_weather("London")
print(f"Temperature: {weather.temperature}¬∞C")
```

### 3. **Interactive API Explorer**
- Add "Try It Now" section to your documentation
- Pre-filled examples users can test immediately
- No auth required for basic demo

### 4. **Better Error Messages**
